		<p id = "text">The Sydney Tower was opened to the public in August 1981 as a shopping centre, with 52 shops initially. Out of the four sections that are available to the public, the first 3 are dedicated towards the Sydney Tower Dining. The fourth level of the Sydney Tower has an observation deck, where tourists can get a full panoramic view of the city of Sydney. The Sydney Tower is also one of the safest buildings in the world, with its ability to maintain itself during earthquakes and extreme wind conditions due to its design. </p>
